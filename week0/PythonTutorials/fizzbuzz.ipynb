The object of the assignment is less about solving it correctly according to the below rules and more about showing the programmer understands basic, necessary tools such as if-/else-statements and loops. The rules of FizzBuzz are as follows:\n","\n","For numbers 1 through 100,\n","\n"," * if the number is divisible by 3 print Fizz;\n"," * if the number is divisible by 5 print Buzz;\n"," * if the number is divisible by 3 and 5 (15) print FizzBuzz;\n"," * else, print the number."]},{"metadata":{"id":"jnfPzmowJEsg","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1717},"outputId":"106bb435-8af5-439a-bace-7c1081d126a7","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1551596658734,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1026,"user":{"displayName":"Arjun Gupta","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-79xPDqhG3Ck/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAE0/PToMHu16xAo/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"06632186555192968294"}}},"cell_type":"code","source":["### First a wrong code to show one common error many students \n","### (and too many experienced programmers) make\n","LIMIT = 101\n","for n in range(1, LIMIT):\n","    if n % 3 == 0: \n","        print(\"FIZZ\")\n","    elif n % 5 == 0:\n","        print(\"BUZZ\")\n","    elif n % 3 == 0 and n % 5 == 0:\n","        print(\"FIZZBUZZ\")\n","    else:\n","        print(n)"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["1\n","2\n","FIZZ\n","4\n","BUZZ\n","FIZZ\n","7\n","8\n","FIZZ\n","BUZZ\n","11\n","FIZZ\n","13\n","14\n","FIZZ\n","16\n","17\n","FIZZ\n","19\n","BUZZ\n","FIZZ\n","22\n","23\n","FIZZ\n","BUZZ\n","26\n","FIZZ\n","28\n","29\n","FIZZ\n","31\n","32\n","FIZZ\n","34\n","BUZZ\n","FIZZ\n","37\n","38\n","FIZZ\n","BUZZ\n","41\n","FIZZ\n","43\n","44\n","FIZZ\n","46\n","47\n","FIZZ\n","49\n","BUZZ\n","FIZZ\n","52\n","53\n","FIZZ\n","BUZZ\n","56\n","FIZZ\n","58\n","59\n","FIZZ\n","61\n","62\n","FIZZ\n","64\n","BUZZ\n","FIZZ\n","67\n","68\n","FIZZ\n","BUZZ\n","71\n","FIZZ\n","73\n","74\n","FIZZ\n","76\n","77\n","FIZZ\n","79\n","BUZZ\n","FIZZ\n","82\n","83\n","FIZZ\n","BUZZ\n","86\n","FIZZ\n","88\n","89\n","FIZZ\n","91\n","92\n","FIZZ\n","94\n","BUZZ\n","FIZZ\n","97\n","98\n","FIZZ\n","BUZZ\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{"id":"rteY_DFEJEsk","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"cell_type":"code","source":["## The above bug removed and we use a function\n","def fizzbuzz(n):\n","    if n % 3 == 0 and n % 5 == 0:\n","        return \"FIZZBUZZ\"\n","    if n % 3 == 0:\n","        return \"FIZZ\"\n","    if n % 5 == 0:\n","        return \"\n","      \n","      \"\n","    return str(n)\n","LIMIT = 101\n","for n in range(1, LIMIT):\n","    print(fizzbuzz(n), end=\" \")"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"_IdbAvXPJEso","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"cell_type":"code","source":["### Slightly better function\n","def fizzbuzz(n):\n","    fb = \"\"\n","    if n % 3 == 0:\n","        fb += \"FIZZ\"\n","    if n % 5 == 0:\n","        fb += \"BUZZ\"\n","    if len(fb) == 0:\n","        return str(n)\n","    else:\n","        return fb\n","fbs = [fizzbuzz(x) for x in range(1,101)]\n","print(fbs)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"TF3KUd_NJEst","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"cell_type":"code","source":["### A rather sophisticated version\n","def pick(n):\n","    return 2 * int(n % 5 == 0) + 1 * int(n % 3 == 0)\n","def fb(n):\n","    return [str(n), \"FIZZ\", \"BUZZ\", \"FIZZBUZZ\"][pick(n)]\n","fbs = [fb(x) for x in range(1, 101)]\n","print(fbs)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"1W9pOr5rJEsw","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]}]}
